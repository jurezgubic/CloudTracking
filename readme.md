3d Cloud tracking code

Running the code (on its own):
1. Set config file in main.py
2. Set correct path to LES data.
3. Run with "python main.py"
4. To inspect output run analysis/output_analysis.ipynb notebook.

Running the code (with memory profiler):
- Uncomment profiler decorators 
- Or "mprof run main.py" and then plot using "mprof plot"
- Warning: Do NOT run for the entire dataset (far too expensive).
