Creating a 3D cloud tracking code.

To do
- Add logic for splitting and merging. 
- Add transformation of the field using wind vectors to improve matching.
- Memory management. Max two cloudfields at a time.
- Additional/different write-out logic: create writeout util that's called iteratively in the main.py for loop.
